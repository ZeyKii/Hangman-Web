# How to change the difficulty
Need to make the game easier or harder? 🤔

1. It's simple, you just have to select your level of difficulty when launching the game.
2. You have the choice between 3 levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard.
3. The higher the level, the harder the words are to find. 🔡
